A paper : Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (CUMTD) is a public transportation system that has established itself as a crucial sociotechnical system for the millions of riders commuting within and around the area. To fulfill its commitment of utilising the most progressive technology to support its passengers, CUMTD has been offering open-source developer resources for anyone who would like to improve upon its arsenal of current applications (apps).

These apps have helped CUMTD’s users better navigate its transit system, but have created some downfalls with their experiences with the system as well. The availability of these tools and the simple app review process have caused CUMTD to offer more than a dozen apps with different names with similar functionalities to appear on CUMTD’s App Garage. Also, most of these apps have become obsolete without new features and bug fixes, because of the third-party developers leaving the apps after their completion. These issues have caused the users to speak out against the apps’ user interface and technology support. This paper will address these issues in detail and offer possible solutions to mitigate them. These solutions include hiring an analysis and development teams to inspect app reviews and develop a consolidated app to reduce confusion and redundancy. Also, the team offers methods to mitigate the user interface and technology issues identified through surveys and app reviews and discusses the issues that may arise with these changes. The current CUMTD apps and its process work, but the suggestions offered by the team would improve their current state to better CUMTD customers’ experiences.
