Eliminating the rampant corruption and improving the pathetic state of public infrastructure building in developing and underdeveloped countries are the primary objectives of this project. We aim to achieve the objective by bringing greater transparency in public sector projects. This project proposes a system to capture all bids for public infrastructure projects on the blockchain. All activities on the project, right from the call for tender, procurement of material, choice of contractor, the status of work will be stored on the blockchain. By opening up the blockchain to the public it will be a fully transparent system. Since the data is stored on the blockchain, it is immutable and each and every update can be traced to the person who made the update and can be independently verified. By publicly disclosing the status of infrastructure and government projects, a greater degree of accountability can be achieved. In order to do this, we introduce a system called TRANSPR, a consensus-based blockchain network. The design of the system is laid out, and the mechanism by which the system maintains state is elaborated. The coin distribution process is also detailed, and the formulae are laid out. As the system is consensus-based, new blocks are created by consensus decisions and not mining. As thereâ€™s no mining or proof of work involved, energy needs of TRANSPR are very less, and it is environmentally sustainable.The major difficulty in the rollout of TRANSPR will be in the adoption phase, as it involves an overhaul of existing processes.
